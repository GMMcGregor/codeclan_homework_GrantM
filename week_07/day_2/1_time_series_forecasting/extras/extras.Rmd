Another option you have where you have two models that are closely working, sometimes averaging them together can produce a better result. In this particular case, the `snaive` model method is also doing a good job, so you could create an averaged model of the `snaive` and `arima`. 


<blockquote class='task'>
**Task - 15 mins** 

Go back to your beer dataset. Create a new `mable` which contains the model fit of the `arima` model, the `snaive` model, and one that averages the two of these models. 

Then forecast 2 years in the future, and check the accuracy of your model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# run the model on the training set 
averaged_models_fit <- beer %>%
  model(
    arima = ARIMA(Beer),
    snaive = SNAIVE(Beer)) %>%
  mutate(avg_model = (arima + snaive) / 2 )

averaged_models_fit

# create the forecast
forecast_avg_test <- averaged_models_fit %>% 
  fabletools::forecast(h = 8)
  
# plot this 
forecast_avg_test %>%
  autoplot(beer, level = NULL) 

# check the accuracy 

accuracy_all_models <- fabletools::accuracy(forecast_avg_test, beer)

beer
accuracy_all_models %>% 
  select(-.type) %>%
  arrange(RMSE)

```
