* You have been provided some customer data from a shopping centre. Do some exploratory analysis on the data. Comment on findings. 

* We are interested in creating a marketing campaign to target customers based on their spending score and annual income. Perform a k-means clustering to find if there are meaningful clusters in the data to target the customers. 

* Perform k-means clustering and chose a value of k.

* Visualise the clustering for your chosen value of k.

* Do you think the clustering seems a good fit for this data?

* Comment on the attributes on one or two of the clusters (maybe even give them a label if you like - like in section 4.1 of the 'Segmentation & clustering intro' lesson).
