#1 Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.

#Samsung has 397 phones
```{r}

#2_For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution.

  )

```

```{r}

#2a_Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?
#looks quite good but could be slightly higher?



#3 We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the `mean()` and `sd()` of your distribution in an earlier question.

#Use these values to calculate the *proportions* of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. 
#79% within 1sd
#92% within 2sd
#98% within 3sd
```{r}
samsung_ratings %>% 
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - samsung_stats$sd) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + samsung_stats$sd) %>%
 # count() for sanity check 
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
  
```

```{r}
samsung_ratings %>% 
filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - (2*samsung_stats$sd)) %>%
filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + (2*samsung_stats$sd)) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_2sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
```

```{r}

samsung_ratings %>% 
filter(rating >= samsung_stats$mean - (3*samsung_stats$sd)) %>%
filter(rating <= samsung_stats$mean + (3*samsung_stats$sd)) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_3sd = n() / nrow(samsung_ratings))
```


#Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.  


```{r}

pnorm(1) - pnorm(-1)
pnorm(2) - pnorm(-2)
pnorm(3) - pnorm(-3)
```
#This samsung_ratings proportions are better fits for the normal distribution at 2sd from the mean than 1sd and even better at 3sd from the mean
